# Sports Analytics: Fantasy Premier League

### By Bigya Bajracharya, Ruben Maharjan, Shirish Khanal

Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is an online game where the user acts as a manager and gathers a team of footballers. With a budget of £100m, the user is required to buy 15 players. Each player is assigned a price based on their past performances, the quality of their club, and their perceived ability to score points, among other factors (REHMAN, 2022). The collected team then earns points based on how the actual footballers perform on each game.

Sports Analytics is an AI model catered to FPL, that predicts which footballers would earn the higher points. This model is based on Twitter data, and the data of the footballers’ past performances, game statistics, and other information. The results are determined by refining these collected data through methods such as sentiment analysis, probabilities, etc.
